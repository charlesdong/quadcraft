# QuadCraft

Absolute Minecraft clone, except for two-dimensional.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create an ABSOLUTE Minecraft clone. Everything, including the textures of blocks and entities, the GUI, maybe even the font, is COMPLETELY the same as in Minecraft. The only difference is the number of dimensions (I mean the dimensions in math, not Minecraft), which is TWO.
